# Connect to DataBase
1. Get the url of mongodb and save it in a variable in .env file
2. Create a Schema of the data you want to enter 
	2.1 Create a Model Folder and in Create a file 
	2.2 Require a mongoose and then create a variable and then create a schema
	2.3 Using new mongoose.Schema({});
	2.4 assign variable in it
3. After that create a variable and then by using [ new mongoose.model("nameofVariable",nameofSchema)
4. In controller  you need to pass this like this 
	const {username,email,phone,password} = req.body;
        const userExits = await User.findOne({email});
5. afterwards you need to validate mail by using userExits in conditional statements 
6. Creating the User
	User.create({username,email,phone,password});
7. all the above things are in try Catch block


# Hashing the password using bcryptjs
1. Require the bcryptjs module in the file.
2. YOu need to using the "pre" function and pass "save" and then a async function to it 
like below
	userSchema.pre("save",async function(next){
        const user = this;
3. Need to check if the password is modified or not 
	if(!user.isModified("password")){
        next();
    }
4. Generating the salt 
	const saltround = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
5. Hashing the password 
	const hash_password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password,saltround);
6. Assignning the value
	 user.password = hash_password
7. Do thing in trycatch block
